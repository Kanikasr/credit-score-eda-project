**Project Overview:**

This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on understanding the patterns and drivers behind credit scores. Credit scoring is a vital component in financial services, determining the creditworthiness of individuals and influencing lending decisions.

Through detailed analysis of customer demographics, loan types, payment behaviors, and financial indicators, this project reveals critical insights into credit risk factors, aiming to support more informed decision-making in risk management and customer targeting.

**Dataset Description:**

-The dataset includes anonymized records featuring:

-Demographic details (age, occupation, income)

-Credit-related variables (credit score categories, credit utilization ratio, credit history age)

-Loan details (types and counts of loans held)

-Payment behavior and delay metrics

**Key Features of the Analysis:**

-Univariate Analysis: Distribution and balance checks of key variables such as age, income, and credit score categories.

-Bivariate Analysis: Investigation of relationships between credit scores and factors like age, income, loan types, and payment behaviors.

-Multivariate Analysis: Complex patterns and interactions among multiple financial features visualized using heatmaps, pair plots, and bubble charts.

-Actionable Insights: Interpretation of findings with implications for credit risk evaluation, product development, and targeted marketing strategies.

**Project Structure:**

File/Folder -	Description:
Credit_Score_EDA.ipynb	- Jupyter notebook with full analysis and visualizations
README.md	- Project overview and documentation

**How to Use:**

1. Open the Google Colab notebook
Click on the provided notebook file (.ipynb) to open it in Google Colab.

2. Mount Google Drive
The notebook uses datasets stored in Google Drive. You will be prompted to authorize Google Drive access — click the authorization link and sign in to your Google account.

3. Raw and Cleaned Dataset Links

The notebook accesses the raw dataset stored privately in the author’s Google Drive for data wrangling and cleaning steps. You will be prompted to authorize access to your own Google Drive to run these steps.

After cleaning, it accesses the cleaned dataset from another location in the Drive for visualization and analysis.
Both dataset paths are already set in the notebook code, so no manual change is needed.

4. Run cells sequentially
Run the notebook cells step-by-step or use “Run all” to execute the entire analysis flow.

5. Requirements:
The notebook uses popular Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. These are pre-installed on Colab, so no additional setup is required.

**Technical Details:**

-Python (3.x) with libraries including pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy.

-Visualizations crafted for clarity, interpretability, and actionable business insights.

-Emphasis on robust data cleaning and feature engineering.

**Data Privacy & Security:**

-This project is designed with data privacy in mind:

-Datasets are accessed only from your secure storage.

-No sensitive or personal data is included or shared publicly.

-You control data access when running the notebook.
